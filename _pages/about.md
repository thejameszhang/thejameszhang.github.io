Hi! I'm James, and I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Computational Finance at the University of Maryland, College Park. I work on financial machine learning, and this past summer, I was a Software Engineering Intern at Capital One.

My current research interests are theoretical and empirical asset pricing and market microstructure. Within asset pricing, I'm working on a latent "tensor factor model" that extends traditional PCA and incorporates a third dimension of lagged firm characteristics ie. pricing signals. Within microstructure, I'm interested in deep reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize trade execution.
