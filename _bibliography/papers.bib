  note = {We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that leverages multimodal data including historical stock prices, 
  sentiment analysis, and topic embeddings from news articles, to optimize trading strategies for SP100 stocks.
  Building upon recent advancements in financial reinforcement learning, we aim to enhance the state space representation by 
  integrating financial sentiment data from SEC filings and news headlines and refining the reward function to better align with 
  portfolio performance metrics. Our methodology includes deep reinforcement learning with state tensors comprising price data, 
  sentiment scores, and news embeddings, processed through advanced feature extraction models like CNNs and RNNs. 
  Empirical results showcase the potential of our agent to outperform standard benchmarks, especially when utilizing combined 
  data sources under profit-based reward functions.},
