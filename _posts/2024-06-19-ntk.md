# TL;DR

Empircal characteristic-based asset pricing models have been widely used to explain differences in average returns of assets since Rosenberg, with the most classic example being the Fama French Three-Factor Model <d-cite key="ff3"></d-cite>. Asset pricing theory asserts that expected returns vary because assets themselves have varying exposure to the stochastic discount factor (SDF). Existing literature primarily implicitly assume that factor betas or risk prices are linear functions of pre-specified characteristics. However, a recent growing literature shows that nonlinear interactions between characteristics are important. 

It follows that researchers turn to deep neural networks (DNNs), but DNNs have long been thought of as a "black box" by researchers and industry experts alike. However, it's become possible to study the evolution of infinite-width feedforward neural networks during training via gradient descent through a special kernel called the **neural tangent kernel (NTK)** <d-cite key="ntk"></d-cite>. Moreover, <d-cite key="ntk2"></d-cite> generalizes the NTK to any architecture whose forward and backpropagation can be expressed as a combination activation functions and matrix multiplications. With these two key results, I'd like to study the use of modern deep neural network architectures -- autoencoders, transformers, and more -- to estimate asset pricing models.
